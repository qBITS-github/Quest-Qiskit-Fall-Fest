## Welcome

This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for BITS Goa. We're so excited to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the qBITS, the quantum tech club of BITS Goa.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September and October to design and plan their event, which are then run in November. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here at BITS Goa is going to be a hackathon, starting on November 22nd. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is November 26th, at 11:59 pm IST. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
